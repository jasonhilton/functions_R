# A Data Analysis Workflow





---
# Workflow

Working with data generally involves an iterative workflow:


- Write exploratory code in scripts 

- Pull out code performing specific tasks into functions

- Make this function as general as feasibly possible
  + Applicable to the greatest number of cases
  
- Document your functions

- Extract these functions into separate R files (perhaps in an `R` folder in your project

- Use `source` in your analysis scripts to read in these functions

- Turn your your functions into a [package]((https://r-pkgs.org/intro.html)) for others doing similar tasks


---
# What do we want from code?

What are some properties of good code?


--
- It should do what I want it to

- Other people should be able to understand it

- It should be easy to work out what's wrong with it

- It should be easy to test that it works

- It should be easy to change


---
# What do we want from code?


Less important:

- It should be fast

&gt; Premature optimisation is the root of all evil


--
Most of the time you will spend on code will be writing, understanding, thinking and debugging.

- Better to prioritise making this easier

- Once you have working code that you can easily reason about, optimisation is easier in any case



--
Rstudio has a nice tool for [profiling](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/218221837-Profiling-with-RStudio)



---
# Excuses

Often researchers are reluctant to invest in making their code readable 

&gt; "Only I will use it" 

You never know when a journal will ask for your code
- Increasingly the norm in many disciplines

Writing robust code to be read and used by others is likely to be an important skill in the wider world


--
The most important reader of your code is *Future You*

&gt; Have you ever looked back a your code and stuggled to remember what it was supposed to be doing?

---
# How do functions fit in?

By breaking our code down into functions, we produce self-contained parts of our analysis process that we can understand in isolation

- Humans are not good at dealing with lots of things all at once

- We have a limited cognitive ability to process information

- Dealing with functions one-by-one means we can focus our attention on the important parts

- This also means that errors are easier to tracking down; we can examine inputs and outputs from particular functions
  + Automated testing frameworks work better on small units of code


- Function also help with optimisation
  + Functions can be analysed to find the bottleneck, and the most expensive function can be optimised.

# Some Principles

---
# 'Clean Code'

One questions that springs to mind is what should these functions look like.

- How do we go about writing them?


Some advice on software design in general is provided in the classic 
*Clean Code* by Robert Martin. 

- This is an extremely opinionated text - to the point of being dogamtic
- It is not designed with R in mind, so not all of his proscriptions are valid 
- It is somewhat old


--
That said, some of the principles can help us in writing functions in R



---
# Principles from 'Clean Code'


Four principles relating to function can be useful to bear in mind:

1. Functions should be small


--
2. Functions should do one thing only


--
3. Functions should have descriptive names


--
4. Functions should have few arguments



---
# Function Length

Some fascinating analysis shows that the majority of functions in the R code-base are relatively short

- The *median* function length is 12 lines

- Most packages have one or more longer function, ~100 lines

[https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-07-how-long-is-a-function/](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-07-how-long-is-a-function/)


--
Why short functions? 

- Short functions are easier to read
- Short functions are easier to change
- Short functions are easier to test
- Short function may be more general, and more likely to find use elsewhere


---
# Function purpose

&gt; Functions should do one thing only

As we mentioned, we (humans) are not good at concentrating on more than one thing.

- Functions that have one purpose greatly reduce our cognitive load
  + We don't have to keep everything else in mind when we write or read it

- Testing parts of our analysis is easier if we can isolate each part in  one function
  + Again, this applies also to automated testing systems like 

- If we want to alter the behaviour of a particular part of our analysis, we alter only the relevant function



---
# Descriptive names

&gt; Functions should have descriptive names

Function names should generally be verbs that describe what the function actually does.



- If I come and read your code, it a function is called `do_stuff` I will be more confused than if it is called `find_optimium_theta`.

- Argument names should similarly be informative:
  - `n_parameters` is better than `k`


--
Generally, longer names are better than shorter names.

- Autocomplete means you will not be slowed down by long names




---
# Number of arguments

&gt; Functions should have few arguments

Functions with many arguments can be confusing to those unfamiliar with the function.

- They are more difficult to call

- Default behaviour may be unclear

- The exact function of each argument might be difficult to determine


--
If you have lots of arguments, this might be a sign that your function is doing more than one thing.

&gt; In some cases, lots of arguments is a necessity, and you will see certainly see this in some base functions

---
# Dependencies should be explicit

Some code relies on 'global variables', that might be defines at the top of a script.


--
Functions that use variables not passed explicitly as arguments are generally to be discouraged.


- If an R function comes across a variable not present in the execution environment, it will look in the enclosing environment
- This can make it difficult to predict function behaviour


--
Instead, pass in these variables as arguments.



---
# Rules are made to be broken

&gt; "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds"

The above rule are largely guidelines.

- They won't necessarily make sense in every situation
- They are also not necessarily valued by all coding professionals
- If following them makes your code seem unnatural or difficult to read, then don't follow them.


--
There are a huge range of competing principles around how to write good code.

These vary a lot by language and paradigm.


--
I do think that in many cases, the principles above can be valuable in writing functions in R.




---
# How to get better

Sometimes it is difficult to work out the best way to proceed.


--
- Go back to old code an improve it

- Read code in popular packages

- Peer code review is often helpful - ask someone to look at your code

- Commit to producing better code for a new project at the beginning
  + This will probably save time in the long term

- Investigate turning your code into a package

- Refer to [style guides](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

- Read about the subject
